# sh.derzombiiie.com
autosetup for DerZombiiie/setup

### how 2 install:

`curl -sL https://derzombiiie.com | sudo bash` or
`curl -sL https://sh.derzombiiie.com | sudo bash`

**USE TLS/SSL/HTTPS**, its not a good idea piping http requests into `sudo bash`!
The latter is the more reliable one as the first one relies on curl having a curl/* user agent
